# Task 8: Clustering with K-Means

This task focuses on unsupervised learning using the **Iris dataset**, exploring the clustering of data points without labeled outputs. It involves determining the optimal number of clusters, applying K-Means, and visualizing the results with PCA.

## 🧠 Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the Iris dataset.
- Performed pairwise visualization using seaborn pairplot.
- Standardized features for better clustering performance.
- Used the **Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of clusters.
- Applied **K-Means clustering** with optimal K.
- Visualized clusters using **PCA-reduced 2D space**.
- Evaluated clustering performance using **Silhouette Score**.

## 📊 Results
- **Optimal K (Elbow Method)**: `3`
- **Silhouette Score**: `0.5512`
- Clusters were clearly separable and aligned closely with true Iris species distribution.

## 📁 Files
- `Iris_Clustering.csv` – Cleaned Iris dataset  
- `Clustering with K-Means.ipynb` – Notebook with all clustering code, visualizations, and evaluation
